Project 1: The Greatest Common Divisor [GCD]

Textbook Section: 7.36

Directions: Implement the Euclidean Algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of any two integers.
These two integers should be able to be positive, negative, zero, or any combination thereof.
(Hint: be careful when dealing with zero and/or negative numbers.)

Input: user inputs two integers a and b
Output: integer d, which is the gcd of the two integers inputted by the user

Extra Credit: Find the linear combination of the 2 given integers which sums to their gcd, using backwards substitution.
The program should display au+bv=d, where you would need to find integers u and v.
